# FED Javascript 1 - Course Assignment

This is a vanilla website that displays a list of items fetched from an API.

This project was bootstrapped with Vite.

## Resources

- [Production deploy](_LINK_TO_WEBSITE_)
- API used: https://portal.thatapicompany.com/pages/dog-api

## Report

This project is a course assignment with the purpose to learn about API and javascript. I chose a dog-API and tried to make my website look kind of like a library of dogs, where you can scroll through all dog breeds, search for specific breeds and click on the breed you like to get some more info (all info fetched from the API). It's my first time ever working with both API and javascript and the code is not perfect. I have tried a few different ways to write javascript code and do functions.

The filtering options are only working separately, meaning that the filters are not connected and has nothing to do with each other. This is something I hope to be able to learn how to fix in near future so that I can make a more advanced and user friendly filtering option.
